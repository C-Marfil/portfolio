    <h3>About me:</h3>
</section>
    <p>Like Marfil (Ivory in Spanish), I could be anything. From a junior developer to a baker, from piano keys to chess sets. </p>
    <p>After working at the intersection between Art and technology, I have chosen to leave the Arts and fully embrace my ever existing relationship with tech. My mother is very happy.</p>
